He has appeared in more than 25 films, and won several accolades including, eight Nandi Awards, five Filmfare South Awards, four South Indian International Movie Awards, three CineMAA Awards, and one IIFA Utsavam Award. One of the highest-paid Telugu film actors,[3] he also owns the production house G. Mahesh Babu Entertainment.

The younger son of veteran Telugu actor Krishna, Babu made his debut as a child artist in a cameo role in Needa (1979), at the age of four, and acted in eight other films as a child artist. He made his debut as a lead actor with Rajakumarudu (1999) which won him Nandi Award for Best Male Debut. Babu achieved his breakthrough with the supernatural drama Murari (2001), and the action film Okkadu (2003). He went on to act in other commercially successful films such as Athadu (2005), Pokiri (2006), Dookudu (2011), Businessman (2012), Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013), 1: Nenokkadine (2014), Srimanthudu (2015), Bharat Ane Nenu (2018), Maharshi (2019), Sarileru Neekevvaru (2020) and Sarkaru Vaari Paata (2022). Pokiri held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film while Sarileru Neekevvaru, his highest grosser, collected over ₹260 crore at the box office.[4][5]

Referred to in the media as the Prince of Tollywood, he is one of the most popular and influential actors of Telugu cinema.[6][7][8] In addition to being an actor, he is a humanitarian and philanthropist – he runs a charitable trust and non-profit organisation, Heal-a-Child.[9] He is also associated with Rainbow Hospitals as their goodwill ambassador.[10] He plunged into the film exhibition business along with Narayandas Narang of Asian Group with the inauguration of the seven-screen superplex at Gachibowli AMB Cinemas.[11]

Ghattamaneni Mahesh Babu was born on 9 August 1975 in a Telugu family in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India.[12] He is the fourth of the five children of Telugu actor Krishna and Indira, after Ramesh Babu, Padmavathi, and Manjula and before Priyadarshini. Their family hails from Burripalem in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh.[13] Babu spent his childhood mostly in Madras under the care of his maternal grandmother Durgamma and the rest of his family.[14] Since Krishna was busy with his film commitments, Ramesh Babu used to look after Mahesh Babu's academic performance.[12] Along with his siblings, Babu used to play cricket regularly at the VGP Golden beach in Madras. To spend time with him, Krishna used to make sure that his films' shoots would be conducted at the VGP Universal Kingdom during the weekends.[12]

Krishna also made sure that none of his children would reveal his name during their schooling to ensure a peaceful environment.[12] He was educated at St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai where actor Karthi was his schoolmate.[15][16] Babu in an interview said that actor Vijay and he have been longtime close friends and studied at the same college,[17] before establishing themselves in their respective film industries.[18] Babu was an above average student. He obtained a bachelor's degree in commerce from the Loyola College, Chennai.[19] After graduating, he met with director L. Satyanand in Vishakhapatnam for further training in acting which went on for three to four months.[19] Being unable to read and write Telugu, he used to memorise the dialogues given by his directors during the dubbing phase of his films

During the shoot of B. Gopal's Vamsi at Australia, Babu began to date his co-star Namrata Shirodkar. After being in a relationship for four years, they decided to get married, and Manjula convinced Krishna in favour of their decision.[19] They were married on 10 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the shooting of Athadu.[201] The couple's first child was born on 31 August 2006 at the Global Hospital in Hyderabad.[202] The boy, named Gautham Krishna, was a premature baby and was in critical condition during his birth. His condition turned stable after the doctors treated him in time.[92] On 20 July 2012, Shirodkar gave birth to a girl whom they named Sitara.[203] Before her delivery, they preserved her stem cells using stem cell banking to ensure a better immunity level.[204]

Babu is the fourth child in a family of five children. His elder brother Ramesh Babu was a film producer and was also an actor. Mahesh Babu's eldest sister Padmavathi is married to Galla Jayadev, an industrialist and Member of the Indian Parliament from the Telugu Desam Party.[205] His elder sister Manjula is a film producer, director, and an actress.[citation needed] Priyadarshini, his younger sister, is married to Sudheer Babu, who later made his debut as an actor in Telugu cinema.[206]

Telugu actress and filmmaker Vijaya Nirmala was Babu's step-mother, and actor Naresh is his step-brother.[207]

 	Mahesh Babu is an Indian actor, producer, narrator known for his work in Telugu cinema. He first appeared in the 1979 film Needa when he was four years old.[1] He continued to perform as a child actor in several films, most of which featured his father Krishna.[2] Following his role as the titular protagonist in Balachandrudu (1990) while still a child, his career went on hiatus so he could concentrate on his education until taking on his first lead role as an adult in the 1999 film Raja Kumarudu, for which he won the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[3][4] Afterwards, his career stagnated until successes like Murari (2001), Okkadu (2003) and Athadu (2005) brought him fame.[2][5] In 2006, he played a gangster in the Puri Jagannadh-directed action-thriller Pokiri. The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time,[6][7][8] and according to Vogue India, cemented Babu's reputation as a "superstar".[9]

In the wake of the failures of Sainikudu (2006) and Athidhi (2007), Babu took a long-term break from cinema for personal reasons.[9][10] His next project, the fantasy action film Khaleja, was released in 2010 after significant delays.[11] In 2011, he starred in Dookudu, which became the first Telugu film to gross over ₹1 billion.[12] Businessman (2012), his next film, was well received and became one of the year's highest grossing Telugu films at a time that was particularly harsh on other big-budget productions.[13][14] The following year, Babu co-starred alongside Venkatesh in the critically and commercially acclaimed drama film Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,[15][16] which was considered the first Telugu multi-starrer in decades.[17][18] He then featured in Sukumar's 2014 psychological thriller film 1: Nenokkadine.[19] Although Babu's performance as a schizophrenic rock star was lauded by critics, the film itself received mixed reviews and failed to recover its budget.[20][21] Aagadu, his next release that year, suffered a similar fate,[22][23] despite the film's opening gross being his highest at the time.[24]
